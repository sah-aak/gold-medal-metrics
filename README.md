# Gold Medal Metrics

## Project Overview

In this project you will be writing all the SQL statements for an Olympic metrics reporting web application called Gold Medal Metrics.

Gold Medal Metrics allows users to:

 - View countries in a list with their population, GDP, and number of Olympic gold medals.
 - Sort the list of countries by any of these attributes, as well as alphabetically by name.
 - View a detailed description of a country, with statistics on their Olympic wins.
 - View a list of every Olympic win a country has with the year, season, winner name, city, and event.
 - Sort the list of Olympic wins by any of these attributes.


## Implementation Details

To complete this project, I will need to write a series of JavaScript functions that return the SQL queries (as strings) that operate Gold Medal Metrics.
